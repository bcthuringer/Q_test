## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Node.js and npm**: Required for running JavaScript code and managing packages
  - *Recommended: Node.js v14 or later*
  - *Installation: https://nodejs.org/*

- **AWS CLI**: Command-line tool for interacting with AWS services
  - *Installation: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/*
  - *Configuration: Run `aws configure` with your credentials*

- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code toolkit for defining cloud resources
  - *Installation: `npm install -g aws-cdk`*
  - *Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/*

- **GitHub Account**: For source control and CI/CD integration
  - *Sign up: https://github.com/*
  - *Create a personal access token with repo and admin:repo_hook permissions*

## Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the application:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # This command installs all dependencies for frontend, backend, and infrastructure
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Bootstrap your AWS environment** (only needed once per account/region):
   ```bash
   # This creates the necessary resources for CDK to deploy infrastructure
   cd infrastructure
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

3. **Deploy the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   # This deploys the core infrastructure components (DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, etc.)
   npm run deploy:infrastructure
   ```

4. **Create GitHub token secret**:
   ```bash
   # First, create a GitHub personal access token in your GitHub account settings
   # Then, deploy the secret management stack
   cd infrastructure
   npm run deploy:github-secret
   
   # Finally, update the secret value in AWS Secrets Manager console with your token
   # Navigate to AWS Secrets Manager > Secrets > github-token > Update secret value
   ```

5. **Deploy the CI/CD pipeline**:
   ```bash
   # This sets up the automated build and deployment pipeline
   cd infrastructure
   npm run deploy:cicd
   ```

6. **Load environment variables from SSM Parameter Store**:
   ```bash
   # This retrieves configuration values from SSM and creates a .env file
   cd frontend
   ../scripts/load-env.sh
   ```

7. **Build and deploy the frontend**:
   ```bash
   # This builds the React application and deploys it to S3
   npm run build:frontend
   npm run deploy:frontend
   ```

8. **Create an admin user**:
   ```bash
   # This creates an administrator user in Cognito
   aws cognito-idp admin-add-user-to-group \
     --user-pool-id $(aws ssm get-parameter --name "/blog/auth/userPoolId" --query "Parameter.Value" --output text) \
     --username admin@example.com \
     --group-name Admins
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment process:

1. **Source Stage**: Monitors the GitHub repository for changes
   - *When changes are detected, the pipeline automatically starts*

2. **Build Stage**: Compiles and packages the application
   - *Installs dependencies using `npm install`*
   - *Builds the frontend application with `npm run build`*
   - *Runs tests to ensure code quality*

3. **Deploy Stage**: Updates the production environment
   - *Uploads built assets to the S3 website bucket*
   - *Invalidates the CloudFront cache to serve new content*
   - *Stores build artifacts in CodeArtifact for future reference*

4. **Post-Deployment**: Performs cleanup and notification
   - *Removes temporary build files*
   - *Sends deployment notifications if configured*

## Cost Optimization Strategies

This project demonstrates several cost optimization techniques:

1. **DynamoDB Provisioned Capacity with Auto-scaling**:
   - *Initial capacity: 5 read/write units (minimum to ensure performance)*
   - *Auto-scales between 5-20 units based on 70% utilization*
   - *Why: More cost-effective than on-demand for predictable workloads*
   
2. **S3 Lifecycle Management**:
   - *Media bucket: Transitions objects to Infrequent Access after 30 days*
   - *Artifact bucket: Automatically deletes objects after 30 days*
   - *Both buckets: Clean up incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days*
   - *Why: Reduces storage costs for infrequently accessed objects*
   
3. **CloudFront Price Class Optimization**:
   - *Uses PRICE_CLASS_100 (North America and Europe only)*
   - *Why: Reduces costs if your audience is primarily in these regions*

4. **CodeBuild Resource Optimization**:
   - *Uses SMALL compute type instead of MEDIUM*
   - *Why: Adequate for most builds while reducing compute costs*

5. **CloudWatch Logs Retention**:
   - *Implements one-week retention policy*
   - *Why: Balances troubleshooting needs with storage costs*

## Security Best Practices

This project implements these security best practices:

1. **Secret Management**:
   - *No hardcoded secrets in code*
   - *All configuration values stored in AWS SSM Parameter Store*
   - *Why: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information*

2. **Environment Variable Handling**:
   - *Sensitive values loaded from environment variables*
   - *Environment variables populated from secure sources*
   - *Why: Separates configuration from code*

3. **IAM Least Privilege**:
   - *Each component has only the permissions it needs*
   - *Resource-specific policies where possible*
   - *Why: Minimizes potential damage from compromised components*

4. **HTTPS Everywhere**:
   - *All communication encrypted using HTTPS*
   - *CloudFront provides SSL/TLS termination*
   - *Why: Protects data in transit from interception*

5. **Authentication Security**:
   - *Cognito handles user authentication with proper password policies*
   - *Multi-factor authentication available*
   - *Why: Implements industry-standard authentication practices*

6. **Input Validation**:
   - *All user inputs validated before processing*
   - *API Gateway request validation*
   - *Why: Prevents injection attacks and malformed data*

7. **CI/CD Security**:
   - *GitHub tokens stored in AWS Secrets Manager*
   - *Build artifacts scanned for vulnerabilities*
   - *Why: Secures the deployment pipeline*

## Estimated Costs

For a small deployment with less than 5 users posting once per day:

- **First Year (with AWS Free Tier)**: ~$1-2 per month
  - *Many services covered by AWS Free Tier for 12 months*

- **After Free Tier**: ~$7-10 per month

Detailed cost breakdown:
- DynamoDB: ~$5.84/month (mostly covered by free tier in first year)
- S3 Storage: ~$0.05/month (assuming ~100MB of storage)
- CloudFront: ~$0.085/month (assuming ~10GB data transfer)
- Lambda Functions: ~$0.30/month (assuming ~10,000 invocations)
- Cognito: Free for first 50,000 users
- API Gateway: ~$0.35/month (assuming ~100,000 API calls)
- CloudWatch Logs: ~$0.10/month (with 1-week retention)
- CI/CD: ~$1.00/month (assuming weekly deployments)
