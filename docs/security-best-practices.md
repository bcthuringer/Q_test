# Security Best Practices for Q_Blog

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the Q_Blog application and provides guidance for maintaining a secure application.

## Secret Management

### GitHub Tokens

- **DO NOT** hardcode GitHub tokens in your code
- Use AWS Secrets Manager to store GitHub tokens
- Use the `deploy-cicd.sh` script to deploy the CI/CD pipeline with proper secret handling
- Rotate GitHub tokens regularly (recommended every 90 days)

### AWS Credentials

- **DO NOT** hardcode AWS credentials in your code
- Use IAM roles for services that need AWS access
- Use the AWS SDK's default credential provider chain
- For local development, use AWS CLI profiles

### Environment Variables

- Store sensitive configuration in AWS SSM Parameter Store
- Use the `load-env.sh` script to load parameters into environment variables
- Include `.env` files in `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive values
- Use clearly marked development values for local development

## Infrastructure Security

### S3 Buckets

- Enable server-side encryption for all buckets
- Enable SSL enforcement for all buckets
- Use appropriate bucket policies to restrict access
- Block public access unless specifically required

### IAM Policies

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use specific resource ARNs instead of wildcards when possible
- Regularly review and audit IAM policies
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unintended access

### CloudFront

- Use HTTPS only
- Use Origin Access Identity for S3 origins
- Configure appropriate cache behaviors
- Implement proper error handling

## CI/CD Security

### Pipeline Security

- Store GitHub tokens in AWS Secrets Manager
- Use webhook triggers with proper authentication
- Implement secrets detection in the build process
- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities

### CodeBuild Security

- Use the latest build images
- Update dependencies regularly
- Implement proper IAM permissions for build projects
- Encrypt artifacts and cache

## Application Security

### Authentication

- Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication
- Implement proper password policies
- Use multi-factor authentication when possible
- Implement proper session management

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize user inputs before displaying them

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Logging

- Enable CloudTrail for AWS API activity
- Enable CloudWatch Logs for application logs
- Implement proper log retention policies
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### Alerting

- Set up CloudWatch Alarms for suspicious activity
- Implement automated responses to security events
- Regularly review security alerts
- Test alerting mechanisms
